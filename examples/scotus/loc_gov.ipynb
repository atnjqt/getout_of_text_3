On\\nJune 24, 1943, respondent instituted this action in the\\nCourt of Claims to recover the additional amount which\\nwhen added to the $12,556.25, the half of the Government\\'s valuation for those cuts, would constitute \"just\\ncompensation\" for what the Government had taken.\\nThe Court of Claims referred the proceeding to a commissioner, who took evidence and reported to the court.\\nUpon the basis of his report and the underlying evidence,\\nthe Court of Claims found as a fact that the replacement cost of the requisitioned pork cuts at the time and\\nplace of the taking was $30,293, and concluded, as a matter of law, that such replacement cost and not the maximum ceiling price was the proper measure of damages for\\nthe taking.

The purpose\\nof these regulations was to afford opportunity for relief to sellers who\\nhad made, or proposed to make, \"contracts or subcontracts\" with the\\nGoyernment. This application had lain dormant from the date of\\nits filing until December 13, 1947, when we were advised by counsel\\nfor the Government that it was now in the files of the Reconstruction\\nFinance Corporation, which is third in the chain of title from the\\n0. P. A., through the Office of Temporary Controls, charged with the\\nadministration of these two regulations. On December 15, 1947,\\nUNITED STATES v. FELIN & CO. 629\\n624 Opinion of FRANKFURTER, J.\\nAt the outset it is important to make clear what it is\\nwe are called upon to decide. The conventional criterion\\ncounsel for the respondent advised the R. F. C. that it withdrew the\\napplication insofar as it pertained to the requisitioned commodities\\nin controversy here.\\nWhile the Government does not suggest that the dormancy of this\\napplication renders present proceedings, if not moot, premature, such\\napparently is the intimation. If the regulations in fact authorized\\n-one who is not a \"contractor or subcontractor\" inthe ordinary meaning of those terms to obtain special administrative relief apart from\\nthe statutory scheme relating to requisitioned property, technical\\nissues would have to be faced which we need not particularize. Counsel for the Government advise us that a counsel for the R. F. C. has\\nnow interpreted the regulations not only (1) as applicable to requisitioned commodities, but (2) as authorizing retroactive price adjustments for requisition transactions completed before readjustment is\\nsought. Not unnaturally, the Government states that the applicability of this procedure for readjustment \"to requisitioned commodities\\nmay not be readily apparent from its terms.\" While normally we\\naccept the construction placed upon a regulation by those charged\\nwith its administration, we must reject a construction that is not\\nonly as unnatural as what is now proposed but comes to us post\\nlitem motam five years after the application. It should also be\\npointed out that the construction now placed upon the regulations\\nis not made by the- administration that promulgated it but by the\\nsecond successor agency for liquidating what is left of this administration. With due regard for the respect we owe to administrative\\nrulings in their normal setting, it would require such a remaking of\\nthe regulations as reason and fair dealing here reject. The provisions for readjustment of contracts relate to a transaction in which\\nthe seller and the purchasing agency of the Government were in\\nagreement as to the contract price. The price was paid, subject to\\nthe approval of the application for adjustment. If so approved,\\nthe seller retained the purchase price; if disapproved, the seller had\\nto make a refund. See Armour & Co. v. Brown,\\'137 F. 2d 233, 240.\\nIn the case of a requisitioned commodity, certainly prior to the filing\\nof an application, no amount is agreed upon, and no provision for\\nrefund has been made. In short, we reject this belated and novel\\nconstruction and are of the opinion that the pendency of this moribund application before the R. F. C., now withdrawn by the respondent, was no bar to this suit.\\nOCTOBER TERM, 1947.\\nOpinion of FRANKFURTER, J. 334 U. S.\\nfor determining what is \"just compensation\" for private\\nproperty-taken for public use is what it would bring in\\nthe free, open market. E. g., Olson v. United States, 292\\nU. S. 246, 255; Brooks-Scanlon Corp. v. United States,\\n265 U. S. 106, 123; L. Vogelstein & Co. v. United States,\\n262 U. S. 337, 340. But there must be a market to make\\nthe criterion available. Here there was a market in\\nwhich the respondent could have sold the pork cuts, but\\nit was not a free and open market; it was controlled in\\nits vital feature, selling price, by the 0. P. A. It is this\\nfact that creates the problem of the case, assuming that\\nthe case is not dogmatically disposed of by holding that\\ninasmuch as the maximum price is the only price which\\nrespondent could legally have got for its goods it is just\\ncompensation. We are not passing on the abstract question whether a lawfully established maximum price is\\nthe proper measure of \"just compensation\" whenever\\nproperty is taken for public use. We are adjudicating\\nonly the precise issues that emerge from this case.\\nThe Second War Powers Act, 1942, under which respondent\\'s property was authorized to be taken, restricted\\ncompensation for the taking to that which the Fifth\\nAmendment enjoins. 56 Stat. 176, 181. In enforcing\\nthis constitutional requirement \"the question is what has\\nthe owner lost, not what has the taker gained.\" Boston\\nChamber of Commerce v. Boston, 217 U. S. 189, 195;\\nMcGovern v. New York, 229 U. S. 363. Respondent\\'s\\nsole claim is for the pecuniary equivalent of the property\\ntaken. This is not a situation where consequential damages, in any appropriate sense of the term, are urged as\\na necessary part of just compensation. Respondent does\\nnot claim such damages on the theory that, in order\\nto protect its good will, it had to supply its regular\\ncustomers and that this compelled replacement of the\\nrequisitioned pork products by the purchase, slaughter,\\nUNITED STATES v.

Marion & Rye Valley R. Co. v. United States,\\n270 U. S. 280,285.\\nThe Court of Claims found that the principal item in\\nthe cost of processing respondent\\'s products was what it\\nhad to pay for live hogs; that, inasmuch as live hogs were\\nnot then covered by price regulation, the Chicago market\\nquotations governed price in the packing industry; that\\nthe Chicago average live hog price was $15.59 during\\nMarch 1943;\\' and that, on the basis of* this price, the\\n4If the respondent had sold the pork products in controversy here\\nto its regular customers, it would have done so at the applicable ceiling\\nprices. If the Government had then requisitioned the property from\\nthese customers, there would have been no question that the ceiling\\nprices would have been the measure of just compensation.\\n5 This was obviously not the cost of the hogs from which the pork\\nproducts requisitioned by the order of March 1, 1943, were processed.\\nThe relevant hogs were purchased in some previous month and at a\\nlower cost.

We are of opinion that in reaching this conclusion the court below failed to take into account decisive\\nfactors for the proper disposition of the action brought\\nby the respondent.\\nWe are dealing with a claim for damages arising out\\nof a transaction pertaining to a particular industry, and\\nthe transaction cannot be torn from the context of that\\nindustry. It is practically a postulate of the slaughtering\\nindustry that replacement cost does not afford a relevant\\nbasis for determining the true value of the industry\\'s\\nproducts. \"Manufacturing operations in the meat packing industry do not consist of assembling raw materials\\nfor the- purpose of obtaining one finished product, but\\nrather of separating or breaking down raw material,\\n(cattle, etc.) into many parts, one of which (dressed\\ncarcass) is the major product, and the other parts of\\nwhich are further processed into numerous byproducts.\"\\nKingan & Co. v. Bowles, 144 F. 2d 253, 254. In consequence, cost in the industry generally is like a fagot that\\ncannot be broken up into simple, isolated pieces. See\\nGreer, Packinghouse Accounting (Prepared by the Committee on Accounting of the Institute of American Meat\\nPackers), passim. \"The accounting procedure in the hog\\nbusiness is even more complicated than that of the cattle,\\ncalf, or sheep business, because the operations involve\\na greater breaking up of the dressed carcass and more\\nnumerous processes extending over considerable periods\\nof time.\" Id. at 33-34. The problem is one of \"joint\\ncost\" in a business which \"produces no, single major\\nproduct,\" id. at 213, with the result that no accountant\\nhas thus far \"been able to devise a method yielding\\nwere processed from hogs of a definite weight for which the respondent paid specific prices in the Chicago, St. Louis, or Indianapolis\\nmarkets.\\nUNITED STATES v.

The pork\\nchop, however, is but one of the many edible hog products.\\nAccording to an estimate about the time of the requisitioning of these pork cuts, there were more than 200 pork\\nitems (exclusive of sausage products) in the market.\\nSee Supplementary Statement of Considerations for Revised Regulation No. 148, Pike and Fischer, 3 OPA Food\\nDesk Book 46,151. \"Most pork products,\" the Administrator found, \"are consumed in a cured or processed\\nstate. Fresh pork products, such as pork chops and fresh\\nham, represent not over 20 per cent of the vast quantity\\nof pork which moves by rail. The remaining 80 per cent\\nreaches the consumer in a wide variety of processed forms,\\nincluding dried, dry cured, sweet pickled, smoked, cooked,\\nbaked, and canned.\" Id. att 46,141.

S.\\nof refined pure lard. For the value of the lard the respondent accepted the administrative award.\" Admittedly, part of the cost of the live hog must be charged to\\nby-products. However, any method of apportioning the\\ntotal cost to the by-products is highly speculative.8\\nSince so much speculative approximation and guesswork entered into the determination of cost, selling price,\\nand profit, the industry, naturally enough, was in almost\\ncontinuous controversy with the Price Administrator\\nabout them. The respondent was party to these controversies. On July 17, 1942, it filed a protest against Maximum Price Regulation No. 148 which was consolidated\\nMeat through the Microscope (rev. ed. 1940); Readings on By-Products of the Meat Packing Industry, collected by the Institute of\\nMeat Packing, University of Chicago (1941); Rhoades, Merchandising Packinghouse Products, Institute of Meat Packing, University of\\nChicago (1929); Tolman, Packing-House Industries (1922).\\n7 Since, as we hold, the value of the individual products can only be\\ndetermined by proportionate allocation from the over-all operations,\\nit seems to us that respondent\\'s acceptance of the award as to the\\nlard was hardly consistent with its rejection of the award as to the\\nother pork products.\\n8 \"On much of the material transferred [from one of the slaughterer\\'s departmental accounts to another], such as blood, bones,\\ntankage, glue stock, etc., there is no ascertainable outside market,\\nand the packers must perforce place quite arbitrary valuations on\\nthis material having no probable relation to either cost or market.\\nAgain certain products are in the green stage when transferred, and\\nan outside market only obtains for the finished stage, with the result\\nthat arbitrary deductions must be made from the finished market,\\nestimated to establish a nonexistent \\'green\\' market.

On the basis of calculations as to the\\ncut-out value or replacement cost of various pork cuts,\\nthe slaughterers contended that the regulation did not\\nallow them sufficient operating margin over the cost of\\nlive hogs. In rejecting the protest, on April 23, 1943,\\nthe Administrator made this ruling: \"The interdependence of all phases of the operations of packing establishments makes precise evaluation of the relationship between prices on dressed and processed meats and live hog\\nprices impossible except in terms of the over-all financial\\nposition of the industry.\" In the \\'Matter of Rapides\\nPacking Co., Pike and Fischer, 1 OPA Opinions and Decisions 243. The respondent, on March 8, 1943, had also\\nprotested, again on the basis of the cost of live hogs,\\nagainst the revision of the regulation. This protest was\\nconsolidated with those of 15 other pork slaughterers and,\\nsubstantially on the ground taken in the Rapides Packing\\nCo. case, this second protest was likewise rejected by the\\nAdministrator.

It is noteworthy that the pork price margins\\nwere almost the only meat price margins which were not\\nchallenged before the Emergency Court of Appeals in\\n9 It is also significant that none of the other 130 protestants sought\\nreview in the Emergency Court of Appeals.

Rev.\\n584.\\nThe considerations which underlay the Administrator\\'s\\nmeat price determinations are most pertinent to the solution of our immediate problem. The result of his analysis\\nwas that the profit-and-loss data on a slaughterer\\'s entire\\noperations were the only dependable figures from which\\nthe fairness of meat prices could be deduced. The Administrator pointed out that the industry, on the basis\\nof its accounting figures, had historically lost money on\\nits meat sales.° Since, however, by taking the by-product\\nsales into full account its operations as a whole were\\nhighly profitable, these meat sale losses were \"more in\\nthe nature of bookkeeping losses which failed to take fully\\ninto account the integrated nature of the industry.\"\\nThese views were approvingly quoted by the Emergency\\nCourt of Appeals in Armour & Co. v. Bowles, 148 F. 2d\\n529, 535.\\nIn both of the consolidated proceedings to which the\\nrespondent was a party, the Administrator explicitly requested to be furnished with the industry\\'s profit-andloss data. In the earlier proceeding, no proof of loss was\\nfiled by any of the protestants. In the Matter of Rapides\\n10,\"It is a notable fact, that according to the present method of\\ndepartmental accounting, the packers are in the habit of showing\\nlow profits or even positive losses in the carcass-meat departments,\\nwhile at thessame time exhibiting large profits in the by-products or\\n\\'specialty\\' departments, the chief reason for this somewhat extraordinary state of affairs being found in the valuations placed upon\\ntransfers.\" Report of the Federal Trade Commission on the MeatPacking Industry (1920), Part V, 56. While a great deal of time\\nhas passed since this 1920 report, the Price Administrator reached\\nthe same conclusions in 1943, and the Emergency Court of Appeals\\nquoted the report more fully in 1945. See Armour & Co. v. Bowles,\\n148 F. 2d at 537.\\nUNITED STATES v. FELIN & CO.\\n624 Opinion of FRANKFURTER, J.\\nPacking Co., supra. In the second proceeding the Administrator made this finding:\\n\"The three Protestants who submitted further evidence did not even thus sustain their claims of individual hardship.

In the proceedings below the respondent neither\\nalleged such a loss nor submitted proof in support of it.\\nSince it has not maintained its burden of proving that the\\nceiling price award entails damages, the judgment of the\\nCourt of Claims cannot stand.\\nThe judgment is reversed with directions to the Court\\nof Claims to enter a judgment for the respondent in an\\namount not exceeding $12,556.25, with interest on the\\namount of $25,112.50 from March 8, 1948, the date of the\\nrequisition, to May 22, 1943, the date of the final award\\nmade by the Directot of the Food Distribution Administration.\\nMR. JUSTICE REED, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and\\nMR. JUSTICE MURPHY join, concurring in the judgment.\\nI agree with the disposition of this case made by JUSTICE FRANKFURTER\\'S opinion. However, I cannot concur\\nin the reasoning by which that result is reached. That\\nopinion holds that the respondent is not entitled to recover\\nits petition filed with the court below. Respondent argues here,\\nhowever, that the effect of the differential is to reduce the return\\nit would have netted if it had been allowed to sell the requisitioned\\nproducts in small quantities. But, bearing in mind that this is a\\nsuit for actual damages, the argument has a fatal weakness. If\\nthe respondent had sold in smaller quantities at the higher ceiling\\nprice and made delivery by truck, it would have incurred all of the\\nexpenses that motivated the differential-invoicing, billing, handling,\\nand transportation. None of these expenses was incurred when the\\nGovernment requisitioned the pork products. The \"loss\" in the\\ngross sales figures would have been counterbalanced, to some extent\\nat least, by the additional expenditures. Cf. Superior Packing Co. v.\\nClark, 164 F. 2d 343, 347-48. All this bears on the guiding consideration that recovery in this action must be related to proof of\\nactual loss.\\nUNITED STATES v. FELIN & CO.\\n624 REED, J., concurring.\\nas \"just compensation\" anything in addition to the ceiling\\nprice unless it can \"establish a loss based on its total operations during the period relevant to the slaughtering of\\nthe hogs from which the requisitioned products were processed\" and \"determine by reasonable allocations the portion of the loss properly attributable to the goods seized\\nby the Government.\" Why a loss on total operations\\nmust be established in order to show the loss on the hog\\nproducts requisitioned by the Government is not clear\\nto me. It is the market value of any product that is\\nthe basis for \"just compensation.\" If there is no real\\nmarket value, cost may be an element in the determination of value. Under the circumstances of this case, any\\nother value than the ceiling price is illusory. Consequently I believe that whenever perishable property is\\ntaken for public use under controlled-market conditions,\\nthe constitutionally established maximum price is the\\nonly proper standard of \"just compensation.\"\\nFive members of this Court express their agreement\\nthat replacement cost, if relevant, has been properly found\\nby the Court of Claims. If replacement cost, determined\\nby any accounting system, is a factor, the evidence on\\nwhich the Court of Claims based its findings of that\\ncost is not before us, and therefore those findings cannot be properly regarded as unsatisfactory. Even if\\nwe assume that the evidence offered did not properly allocate costs, the Government raised no such issue by its petition for certiorari or in its brief. The record does show a\\nfinding of replacement cost based upon some evidence.\\nIn the absence of that evidence from the record, it must be\\nassumed that it would support the findings. If we assume\\nthat replacement cost is relevant, to say that a manufacturer who proves that cost by the results of his own system\\nof cost accounting may not retain his award because a\\nmore accurate accounting system exists, though not offered in evidence, disregards the salutary rule that\\nOCTOBER TERM, 1947.\\nREED, J., concurring. 334 U. S.\\nlitigants in civil matters must be allowed to frame their\\nissues and prove their cases in trial courts as each desires. This principle includes the introduction of such\\nrelevant evidence as each wishes to introduce. Often\\nproof of value or damages is difficult. Courts then reach\\nconclusions from the relevant evidence presented. Palmer v. Connecticut Railway & Lighting Co., 311 U. S.\\n544; Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, 327 U. S. 251.\\nFindings are properly made on the basis of the relevant\\nevidence heard and are not subject to attack because\\nother available evidence might have been produced.\\nThe suggestion of JUSTICE FRANKFURTER\\'S opinion as to\\na better method for determining replacement cost is futile,\\nsince it furnishes a rule, rejected by the majority of this\\nCourt, for the Court of Claims to use in determining just\\ncompensation. The approval of the method of determining replacement cost used by the Court of Claims by a\\nmajority of this Court logically requires a decision on\\nwhether or not the ceiling price represents \"just compensation.\"\\nIt may be assumed that the respondent cannot replace\\nthe requisitioned hog products at the ceiling price. If\\nrespondent was impelled to replace the requisitioned products in its stock, its reasons for so doing lay in the realm\\nof business judgment. There was no legal compulsion.\\nIt acted to keep its line of goods complete, to serve its\\ncustomers and to preserve its good will. Any additional\\ncost to the respondent caused by replacing the products\\nwas a consequential damage for which compensation is\\nnot given in federal condemnation proceedings. United\\nStates v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U. S. 372,.378. See United\\nStates v. General Motors Corp., 323 U. S. 373, 382.\\nIt has been long established that in a free market the\\nmarket price is the proper criterion for determining \"just\\ncompensation.\" Olson v. United States, 292 U. S. 246,\\n255; Brooks-Scanlon Corp. v. United States, 265 U. S.\\nUNITED STATES v. FELIN & CO.\\n624 REED, J., concurring.\\n106, 123. In Vogelstein & Co. v. United States, 262 U. S.\\n337, this Court held that the prevailing price in a controlled market was \"just compensation.\" The Vogelstein\\nCompany was a wholesaler of refined copper. Between\\nSeptember 28, 1917, and February 1, 1918, the United\\nStates requisitioned from the Company 12,542,857 pounds\\nof copper for which it paid 23.5¢ per pound. But this\\nprice was notA the result of the interplay of supply and\\ndemand on a free and open market; it was a price fixed\\nby an agreement made by the War Industries Board with\\ncopper producers and approved by the President on September 21, 1917. Vogelstein Company, although not a\\nproducer, had apparently cooperated with the producers\\nin the establishment and maintenance of the 23.5¢ price.\\nThe Company argued that it was entitled to 26.8¢ per\\npound-the average cost to it of the copper requisitioned\\nby the United States. This Court concluded that paying\\nthe fixed 23.50 was correct. \"The market price was paid.\\nThe market value of the copper taken at the time it was\\ntaken measures the owner\\'s compensation.\" 262 U. S.\\nat 340. Consequently, the judgment of the Court of\\nClaims dismissing the company\\'s petition was affirmed.\\nThis acceptance of the fixed price as the market value\\nclosely approaches the situation now presented.\\nIt would be anomalous to hold that Congress can constitutionally require persons in the position of the respondent to sell their perishable property to the general\\npublic at a fixed price or not to sell to anyone\\' and later\\nto hold that the Government must pay a higher price than\\nthe general public where it requisitions the perishable\\nproperty because of a replacement cost, greater than the\\nfixed price. It is true that the United States by exercising\\nits power of requisitioning compelled the respondent to\\n1 See Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414; Bowles v. Willingham,\\n321\\'U. S. 503.\\nOCTOBER TERM, 1947.\\nREED, J., concurring. 334 U. S.\\nsell to it; but the compulsion to sell to the general public\\nat ceiling prices was hardly less severe. The choice was\\nbetween sales at the fixed price or, at the best, economic\\nhibernation and, at the worst, economic extinction. The\\ntwo situations are so parallel that the constitutionally\\nestablished maximum price may, under the circumstances\\nhere, be properly taken as the measure of \"just compensation.\" That lawfully fixed market price determines what\\nthe perishable article can be sold for or its market value\\nin any real sense. It gives to the condemnee any profit\\nfor increased value in his hands and takes nothing from\\nhim that he could lawfully obtain since consequential\\ndamages for loss of good will cannot be obtained. Such\\nmaximum price is \"just compensation.\" \\'\\nIf the Government fixed prices with the predominant\\npurpose of acquiring property affected by its order, a\\ndifferent situation would be presented. Here we have\\nprice regulation of meat products on a national scale with\\njudicial review of those regulations. The Government\\nsought for itself no unique opportunity to purchase.\\nThe respondent, as JUSTICE FRANKFURTER\\'S opinion\\npoints out, filed several protests against the Maximum\\nPrice Regulations controlling the ceiling prices of hog\\nproducts. These protests were rejected by the Administrator and review by the Emergency Court of Appeals was\\nnot sought. It was during the course of these proceedings that evidence of the profit and loss of the industry\\nand of the replacement cost of pork products could properly be introduced. However, once the maximum price\\nhad been set and had not been set aside by direct attack,\\nthat price became the only relevant measure of just compensation. Whether normally admissible or not,\\' the replacement cost of perishable articles then subject to price\\ncontrol, bought to maintain the good will of a business,\\n2 Cf. Nortz v.

FELIN & CO.\\n624 RUTLEDGE, J., concurring.\\ncannot be an element in the determination of value to\\nfix just compensation. Therefore, evidence of replacement cost in condemnation proceedings such as that\\nbefore the Court today is irrelevant and should not be\\nadmittecd.\\nMR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE, concurring.\\nSix members of the Court agree that the judgment of\\nthe Court of Claims must be reversed, but are equally\\ndivided in their groundings. Since I am in partial agreement with both groups, I state my own conclusions\\nindependently.\\nIt may be, as my brother REED and those who join\\nwith him think, that the ceiling price in a wartime controlled market should furnish the measure of constitutional just compensation for property of a highly perishable nature taken. Perhaps also this view should be\\nqualified further, as by some limitation which would make\\nadjustments beyond that price permissible when the circumstances of the taking are such that they would entail\\ndestruction of property values beyond those inherent\\nmerely in the property which the Government receives\\nand uses.1\\nBut I am also in agreement with my brother FRANKFURTER and those who concur with him that it is not\\nnecessary to reach these important constitutional issues\\nin this case. For I think that, with reference to such\\nperishable commodities taken under circumstances like\\nthese, the legal market or ceiling price furnishes at least\\n1 In some situations the Court has allowed compensation for the\\ndestruction of property as being equivalent to \"taking\" it, cf., e g.,\\nUnited States v. Welch, 217 U. S. 333; Richards v. Washington Terminal Co., 233 U. S. 546; United States v. General Motors Corp.,\\n323 U. S. 373, 384; in others apparently what amounted in effect\\nto destruction has been regarded as infliction of consequential injuries\\nand thus as not compensable, cf. e. g., Bothwell v. United States, 254\\nU. S. 231; Mitchell v. United States, 267 U. S. 341.\\nOCTOBER TERM, 1947.\\nRUTLEDGE, J., concurring. 334 U. S.\\npresumptively the measure of just compensation, and that\\nthis measure should apply unless and until the owner\\nsustains the burden of proving that he has sustained\\nsome loss for which he is entitled to a greater award.\\nThat burden, I also agree, the respondent has not\\nsustained in this case. The Court of Claims awarded\\nrespondent its \"replacement costs,\" in the view that\"when property is taken the owner must be put in as\\ngood position pecuniarily as he was in before his property\\nwas taken.\" 2 Payment of the ceiling price did not do\\nthis, since as the court pointed out respondent \"felt\\nobliged to furnish its customers a certain amount of products, although at a loss, in order to retain their good\\nwill and ...hold its organization together.\"\\'  For this\\nreason it became necessary for respondent to go into the\\nmarket and purchase live hogs and process them, paying\\na higher price than it had paid for the hogs from which\\nthe products taken had been processed. In this way respondent incurred a loss it would not have incurred had\\nthose products not been taken.\\nOn this basis, I agree with MR. JUSTIcE REED that the\\nloss is one for consequential damages. That is, it is one\\nto compensate for loss incurred to preserve unimpaired\\n.2 107 Ct. Cl. 155, 165. For this grounding the court relied upon\\ncitation of Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 299;\\nBrooks-Scanlon Corp. v. United States, 265 U. S. 106,, 125; United\\nStates v. Miller, 317 U. S. 369, 374; Walker & Co. v. United States,\\n105 Ct. Cl. 553. The quoted statement, of course, taken abstractly,\\nis broad enough to permit the award of consequential damages, an\\neffect contrary to this Court\\'s consistent rulings. See the authorities\\ncited in note 4.\\na 107 Ct. Cl. 155, 165. The record before us contains no proof\\nthat replacing the requisitioned goods was\\'essential to prevent respondent from going out of business or that the loss of good will\\nentailed. by the taking, if not repaired by replacement, would have\\nprevented continued employment of respondent\\'s employees or disrupted its organization.\\nUNITED STATES v. FELIN & CO.\\n624 RUTLEDGE, J., concurring.\\nrespondent\\'s good will,\\' not to compensate for any value\\nlawfully obtainable for the articles then or prospectively\\nwithin any reasonable future period, in view of the\\nproperty\\'s perishable nature, from other sources.\\nBut respondent asserts its claim to \"replacement value\"\\non a different theoretical basis, i. e., not as compensation\\nfor loss incurred in preserving good will, but as the proper\\nmeasure of the value of the property when requisitioned.\\nAnd if market price, here ceiling price, is not the measure\\nof compensation, it is said \"replacement cost\" furnishes\\nthe best substitute or at any rate an appropriate element\\nfor consideration.\\nThe difference in the present circumstances would seem\\nto be highly verbal. For in any event the loss was actually incurred for the purpose of keeping respondent\\'s customers satisfied and thus preserving its good will unimpaired; in other words, to prevent the accrual of injury\\nconsequential to the taking.\\nIt is true that in circumstances where there is no market value, \"replacement cost\" has been held appropriate\\nfor consideration in reaching a judgment concerning the\\nvalue which is just compensation. But this seems to me\\na different thing from allowing such proof, when the\\nloss it reflects has been incurred solely to prevent consequential injury, and there is a market value presumptively\\nvalid to compensate for all losses incurred except that\\nloss. To allow that proof in these circumstances would\\nbe in substance if not in forjm to permit an award for\\nelements of consequential damages entirely out of line\\nwith the policy of this Court\\'s prior decisions concerning\\ncompensation for such injuries.\\'\\n4 See United States v.

S.\\nThe considerations set forth by my brother FRANKFURTER respecting the difficulties, indeed the near impossibility, of proving costs in this case would seem to support\\nthis conclusion. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment\\nof the Court.\\nMR. JUSTICE JACKSON, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.\\nIt would appear that this Court in this case is exceeding\\nthe limitation placed by Congress on its review of Court\\nof Claims decisions. 28 U. S. C. § 288; 53 Stat. 752.\\nThe Court does not decide, as Congress has authorized it\\nto do, that any finding of the Court of Claims is not supported by substantial evidence, or that the ultimate findings lack support in evidentiary findings, or that there has\\nbeen a failure to make findings on the material issues.\\nInstead, in effect it sets aside the judgment below on its\\nown interpretation of \"recognized facts in the meat industry.\" Of these it takes judicial notice on the basis\\nof an assortment of publications which, whatever their\\nmerits if called to the attention of the court below, should\\nnot in this Court outweigh specific findings of fact by\\nthe Court of Claims based on evidence before it.\\nTaking the facts as found by the Court of Claims, the\\ncase is this: Claimant was a meat packer and among\\nits products were pork chops. The Government set a\\nmaximum price at which pork chops could be sold. It\\nset no maximum price on the two principal factors in the\\ncost of pork chops, viz: live hogs and labor. The result\\nwas that claimant\\'s uncontrolled costs mounted until, on\\nwhat is found to be a fair allocation of costs between\\nchops and other products of the hog, it was costing more\\nto produce the pork chops than the price for which claimant was permitted to sell them. But there were certain\\ncollateral benefits derived from supplying old patrons,\\neven at a loss, to avoid heavier losses from shutting down\\nUNITED STATES v. FELIN & CO.\\n624 JACKSON, J., dissenting.\\nthe business and to keep customer good will for the hopedfor day of normal business.\\nHowever, the Government decided to buy claimant\\'s\\nchops. It offered the maximum OPA price. As there\\nwas no such compensating advantage to the packer in\\nselling its choice cuts to the Government at a loss, as in\\nkeeping its business going with its general customers, it\\nrefused the offer. The Government then seized its pork\\nchops and the company now claims the \"just compensation\" which the Constitution guarantees to those whose\\nprivate property is taken for public use. The Government contends, and the practical effect of the Court\\'s\\nholding is, that the company can recover only the maximum price fixed for its products by the Office of Price\\nAdministration, in spite of the finding that this is less\\nthan it cost to produce or to replace them.\\nIt is hard to see how just compensation can be the legal\\nequivalent of a controlled price, unless a controlled price\\nis also always required to equal just compensation. It\\nnever has been held that in regulating a commodity\\nprice the Government is bound to fix one that is adequately compensatory in the constitutional sense, so long\\nas the owner is free o keep his property or to put it on\\nthe market as he chooses. If the Government were required to do so, the task of price regulation would be\\nconsiderably, if not disastrously, complicated and retarded. It seems quite indispensable to the Government\\nitself, for the long-range success of price controls, that\\nfixed prices for voluntary sales be not identified with\\nthe just compensation due under the Constitution to one\\nwho is compelled to part with his property.\\nThe war did not repeal or suspend the Fifth Amendment. United States v. New River Collieries, 262 U. S.\\n341, 343; United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S.\\n81, 88. But it is obvious that the constitutional guaranty\\nof just compensation for private property taken for pubOCTOBER TERM, 1947.\\nJACKSON, J., dissenting. 334 U.

The Fifth Amendment\\'s \"exact limitation on the power of the government\" \\' is not market\\nprice-it is just compensation. The former is relevant,\\nand -this Court has so considered it, only because, in a\\nfree market, it is perhaps the best key to value at the\\ntime of taking. Original cost and replacement cost yield\\nto it only because of that factor. But here, there is no\\ntrue market price \\' to provide the usually accepted standard of value. The relevance of original cost and replacement cost, even in this situation, cannot seriously be\\ndenied.
