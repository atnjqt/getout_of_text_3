This is part of the array of delights that Toni Reid , Amazon \\'s vice president of Alexa experience and Echo devices , thinks about when she considers the future of the smart speaker she \\'s overseen from its earliest inception . <p> It starts with the human element . \" What surprised us was how many times people were asking questions that did n\\'t need an answer , \" Reid told the crowd at Fortune \\'s Fortune \\'s Brainstorm Tech conference in Aspen , Colo on Monday . People so often share things like expressions of loneliness and frustration , or a romantic longing for \" Alexa \" herself , that their editorial team spends a lot of time thinking about how the service can continually respond in ways that are relevant . \" We work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer experience .... And we \\'ve taken that approach globally , \" said Reid . <p> But these Alexa \\'s delights are not without risk . <p> Reid addressed a recent incident in which an Alexa device recorded an Oregon woman \\'s private conversation and shared it with a random person in her contact list . Privacy has always been top of mind , said Reid , ticking through a list of design elements : The device has a mute button ; it lights up to show users it \\'s listening ; and owners can review and delete whatever Alexa has recorded them asking or saying . Heck , people can unplug it if they want to . \" We built in multiple safeguards and it still failed , \" Reid said . <p> She understands how that incident makes consumers who are already concerned about data privacy even more nervous . According to Reid , the data Alexa collects is only used to improve the speech technology itself , to better understand the intent of the consumer . \" Nothing else . \" <p> Reid just celebrated her twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gray badge . \" To match the gray in my hair , \" she joked . \" We were just a bookstore , \" she said when she first became of only 600 Amazon employees . <p> Even though Amazon boasts more than a half million employees now , she says the company operates more like a collection of start-ups . \" We can try new things , fail fast , and take an interactive approach , \" she said . \" Alexa was a bold bet we thought we could make . \" <h> SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT <h> You May Like <h> Stories From <h> Read More <h> Sign Up for Our Newsletters <p> Sign up now to receive FORTUNE \\'s best content , special offers , and much more .', '<h> Walmart Bets On Ever Faster Delivery to Compete With Amazon <p> Research firm eMarketer \\'s recent prediction that Amazon.com(amzn) would control nearly half of all U.S. e-commerce this year prompted many analysts to focus on the converse -- that Amazon \\'s online competitors continue to fall further behind . <p> The retailer \\'s extensive network of 4,700 stores gives Walmart the distribution points it needs near most Americans to achieve its ultimate goal within five years : same-day delivery of fresh and frozen food , as well as other Walmart wares , to most of the country . That \\'s something Amazon also has its eye on and was a key factor in its $13 billion decision to buy Whole Foods last year . <p> \" We \\'re playing to our strengths right now , \" Lore said at Fortune \\'s Brainstorm Tech conference in Aspen , Colo. , on Monday . \" Everyone is racing toward same-day delivery and I think we \\'re set up really well . \" <p> Though Lore has played his cards close to the vest , he made clear that Walmart ( wmt ) , which he joined two years after selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressively in faster delivery . <p> \" We can see where the puck is going- it \\'s toward faster delivery time , \" said Lore . <p> Same-day delivery will be the bare minimum a retailer needs to offer customers , especially for the 100,000 or so items Walmart sells most commonly . So a web site that is only transactional and about convenience wo n\\'t be enough for consumers . <p> That is why Walmart has been busy in the last year and a half buying brands such as Bonobos , Modcloth and Moosejaw , and recently started to host a section on its e-commerce site for struggling fashion retailer HBC \\'s ( hbc ) Lord &amp; Taylor , the first of many such deals Lore has said people should expect . \" Proprietary product and assortment is going to be key , \" he said . <p> Yet building up Walmart \\'s delivery speed will remain a key objective , and an area where Lore believes Walmart can effectively fight Amazon . <p> \" That \\'s a big place where we \\'re going to play offense and ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> You May Like <h> Stories From <h> Read More <h> Sign Up for Our Newsletters <p> Sign up now to receive FORTUNE \\'s best content , special offers , and much more .', '<p> Jul 17 , 2018 ( marketresearch.biz via COMTEX ) -- The new research from MarketResearch.Biz on Global Wearable Camera Market Report for 2018 destined to provide target audience with the latest information on Wearable Camera market with the help of refined data and opinions from Wearable Camera industry experts .

But were his comments treasonous , as former CIA chief John Brennan said ? Or was it , as John McCain thundered , ? ? ? one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory ? \" <p> Trump ? ? ? s critics responded with customary vitriol and excess , attacking the president in such extreme terms that his supporters only dig in even deeper . Democrats and never-Trumpers can not help themselves ; over the past two years , the public has grown weary of the non-stop , five-alarm fires , and they have tuned out . <p> To be sure , President Trump missed an opportunity to publicly and sternly warn Russian President Vladimir Putin against interfering in future U.S. elections . Just as importantly , he never articulated why it was crucial to reset relations with Russia , as every preceding administration has tried to do . He failed to describe the many arenas in which the two countries could work together . <p> But really , did anyone really expect him to declare the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the point of traveling to Helsinki and arranging a summit between the world ? ? ? s two biggest nuclear powers , only to scuttle the chance at a new and improved relationship ? It wasn ? ? ? t going to happen , and in fact Trump hinted at that beforehand , when he told reporters not to expect \" a Perry Mason \" moment . <p> Did anyone really expect Trump to declare the Russian leader a liar on global TV ? What would have been the point of traveling to Helsinki and arranging a summit between the world \\'s two biggest nuclear powers , only to scuttle the chance at a new and improved relationship ? <p> Critics were most irate that Trump , in answering a question , didn ? ? ? t unreservedly say that he trusted our intelligence agencies more than Putin . On the other hand , that would have amounted to calling Putin a liar to his face . And , let ? ? ? s face it , as the months have passed and the politically conflicted behavior of James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to light , one may forgive the president for not leaping to the defense of the FBI , at least . <p> After all , he was probably outraged , as all Americans should be , that the Justice Department chose -- just three days prior to the summit -- to release the indictments of 12 Russians accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic organizations . It certainly appeared to be an effort to undermine the president ? ? ? s meeting with Putin , or at least a not-so-gentle reminder from special counsel Robert Mueller that Trump ? ? ? s relationship with Putin was still being investigated . That seems like an act of gross insubordination . <p> President Trump is absolutely correct that there are many issues on which we could use Russia ? ? ? s help . First is terrorism . Russia has been repeatedly attacked by Muslim extremists , just like the U.S. In 2004 , a group of armed Islamic terrorists , mostly from Chechnya , held more than 1,000 people hostage at a school in the North Caucasus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than 300 people lay dead , including 186 children . <p> In 2010 , 40 people died when suicide bombers attacked Moscow ? ? ? s subway system . Just last year a suicide bomber killed himself and several others in the St. Petersburg metro . <p> Trump was not going to call out Putin publicly , and we do n\\'t know what was said in private <p> This is one arena in which information sharing has been and will be fruitful . Last December , Putin thanked President Trump for the CIA ? ? ? s help in thwarting a planned bombing of the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg ; at the time he promised to continue sharing anti-terror information . <p> The U.S. could also use Russia ? ? ? s help as it attempts to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program . Though China is the hermit kingdom ? ? ? s major trading partner , Russia is also important to Kim Jong Un ? ? ? s economic survival . Russia has nothing to gain from North Korea ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help tighten the screws on Pyongyang ? ? ? s economy . <p> Syria is a major issue to both Russia and the U.S. President Trump would like to exit that war-torn country , but needs Russian cooperation to make that happen . He wants Moscow to convince Iran to withdraw from Syria , in exchange for allowing the survival of Bashar Al-Assad ? ? ? s government . Trump needs to assure Israel that it will be secure , and Putin agreed at the summit that , \" As far as Syria is concerned , the task of establishing peace and reconciliation in this country could be the first showcase example of successful joint work . \" It was not by chance that Israel ? ? ? s Netanyahu met with Putin just days before the Helsinki summit , and also spoke to President Trump . <p> We do not know what President Trump and President Putin discussed in their two-hour , one-on-one meeting in Helsinki . We do not know what concessions the former KGB officer may have made , or what the former billionaire real estate mogul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putin on the hacking of the DNC and other intrusions into the U.S. democratic process . <p> But , we do know that since taking office , President Trump has taken a much harder line on Russia than did his predecessor . President Obama visited Moscow in 2009 and soon thereafter abandoned a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic that infuriated Russia . Trump has since reinstated the program . Obama refused to send military-grade weapons to the Ukraine ; Trump is doing so . Obama was reluctant to ramp up liquified natural gas exports that would compete with Russian gas , but Trump is prioritizing such shipments and calling out Germany for its reliance on Russian energy . <p> Trump has surrounded himself with Russia hawks like National Security Advisor John Bolton and Defense Secretary James Mattis . If he were in cahoots with the Kremlin , he has a funny way of showing it . <p> The reaction to the Helsinki conference was over the top , given how little we know about what went on behind the scenes . It was also sad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? s critics wanted him to fail .

Yet we have other senses as well . And now meet our surprising latest detector : the immune system . What \\'s that you say ? The anatomy textbooks show that the brain and the immune system are almost completely isolated from each other ? I thought so , too . But , as usual , researchers probing the world have turned up some fresh insights about how things work . <p> In our cover story , \" The Seventh Sense , \" neuroscientist Jonathan Kipnis describes the relationship between the nervous and immune systems . \" Mounting evidence indicates that the brain and the immune system interact routinely , both in sickness and in health , \" he writes . The immune system may \" qualify as a kind of surveillance organ that detects microorganisms in ... the body and informs the brain about them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmit auditory signals . \" <p> So science giveth , but sometimes it also taketh away . For instance , \" Is Dark Matter Real ? \" ask theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder and astrophysicist Stacy S. McGaugh . This invisible type of matter is thought to accompany the normal matter in the universe to explain how stars orbit in galaxies and how galaxies move in clusters . But astrophysicists have made numerous observations that are difficult to explain with theories about dark matter . Perhaps there \\'s more to gravity than Einstein taught us ? The idea that gravity may need to be modified is not widely held , but like the once unquestioned belief in the separation between the brain and immune system , maybe the area is worth a second look . <h> Sustainable Cities <p> Usually I \\'m based in one of the world \\'s great cities , New York .

      "<h> Fallout 76 journal , day 3 : in search of friends and fun <h> No more following orders <p> Last week saw the debut of Fallout 76 , the first online-only , multiplayer-focused entry in the post-apocalyptic series . Given its massive size and ever-evolving world , instead of a traditional review , we 'll run a series of journal entries chronicling our adventures in Bethesda 's devastated version of West Virginia . Expect to see new entries every other day for the next few weeks . <p> My first few days in the wasteland have been all about following orders . I 've listened to everybody : the missing Vault 76 overseer , all kinds of malfunctioning robots , and a whole bunch of people who turned out to be dead . I 've read their notes , listened to their holotapes , and pored over their journals and terminal logs . <p> It made sense at first . When I first left the vault , I had no idea what to do , where to go , or how to survive . Having some instructions to follow , especially from folks with a bit more experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also got boring really quick . What 's the point in rebuilding America if you 're not enjoying yourself ? <p> I need to find somewhere to enjoy myself . I pull out my Appalachia map , and pick the first place that sticks out at me . Down in the southwest there 's a big sign for a Mothman Museum . That sounds cool . I decided to head straight there -- and this time , it 's my decision . <p> It is , however , also a long walk to the museum . I take the road , which tends to be safer than the woods , and make my way past burned-out farms , houses , and the remains of small towns . Outside of a house that only has two walls left standing , I bump into Graham , my super mutant friend who , unlike the rest of his species , seems completely non-violent . He 's a trader , not a fighter . <p> I start browsing his wares , looking for something I can use to make tea , since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . But I do n't get to look for long : a swarm of mierlurks , mutated soft-shell sea creatures , starts attacking us . To my surprise , Graham defends himself aggressively , quickly taking out the creatures with his shotgun . <p> This gives me an idea . Wandering the wasteland gets pretty lonely , doubly so when you have to deal with all of the dangers lurking about . It 's easy to get overwhelmed when there are a dozen ghouls rushing toward you . So I decide to stick with Graham for a bit . He 's walking in the same direction anyway , and it makes me feel a lot less tense knowing he 's around . <p> Things go slowly . Graham moves at a measured pace , as does his pack animal , a two-headed bovine named Moo Moo . He also does n't say much . But even still , having him around is a small comfort . Those are hard to come by in the wasteland . And it 's not long before we get into another skirmish . Near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , we run into a gang of super mutants . <p> It turns out that not only is Graham unlike the rest of his species , but he also does n't seem to get a long with them much either . A half dozen mutants start attacking him with axes and bats , while one hangs back , firing some kind of machine gun . No one seems to even notice I 'm there . While the mutants are a lot stronger than me , I 'm able to sneak up on them and slowly take them out from behind , making quick work of it with my 10mm pistol . Being unnoticed has its benefits . <p> The one good thing about super mutants is that they love weapons . So defeating a whole crew means getting a lot of free ammo and guns . In fact , it takes me so long to loot the bodies that I lose track of Graham and Moo Moo . I follow the road in the same direction we were walking , but do n't see any sign of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even an old hot dog stand on the side of the road , but not my new friends . A robotic farmhand attacks me , and when I shoot it , it erupts in flames . <p> Then I hear Graham muttering to himself near a transmissions tower on the edge of a huge cliff . He 's just standing there , completely still , on a rocky outcrop . I sit down and wait for a few minutes but he stays the same . I 'm not sure what 's wrong with him , but I decide to head off on my own . <p> The rest of the journey is mostly uneventful . It 's dark , so I switch on my Pip-Boy flashlight , but the hazy green light does n't offer much to see . There are old farmhouses made a touch less gloomy with Halloween decorations , and shops and restaurants that have all been boarded up . No one or no thing bothers me . Not even those pesky giant mole rats that love to jump out of the ground and bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town along the water , with a large bridge that connects it to the western-most part of Appalachia . It 's also completely overrun by the scorched , a slightly more intelligent form of feral ghoul . There must be about two dozen of them , and they 're everywhere : hiding behind cars on the bridge , on rooftops firing guns at me , and resting inside buildings . I really wish Graham was here . It 's so dark that I can barely see their charred black bodies , and it 's particularly annoying having to deal with the rooftop snipers . They have shockingly good aim . They even manage to shoot at me through the windows of buildings I try to hide in . <p> Scouring the strip for scorched is mostly a tedious process , as they do n't pose all that much of a threat . But they 're quite the nuisance . It 's hard to do much of anything with bullets whizzing by . After about 20 minutes I 'm confident the scorched are all gone , and I head toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top floor , though it 's curiously empty . No furniture , just a few piles of empty boxes stuffed away in the corners . <p> Down a small flight of stairs is the actual museum and , well , there 's not much to see . There are display cases where things used to be , but right now they 're almost entirely empty , looted long ago . The only cool thing I find is a huge mothman statute , but it 's locked behind glass which seems to be indestructible . I was hoping for a souvenir to bring back to my wood cabin , but alas . <p> Despite this setback , I 'm determined to have some fun . There has to be somewhere out here in the post-apocalypse that I 'll enjoy . I pull out my map again and have a look . A ways north , just before the charmingly named Toxic Valley , there 's an amusement park . I 'm sure it 's in rough shape , but I 'm hopeful it still retains some of its charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not so sure it 's worth surviving in this wasteland.\n",
      "<h> Researchers unravel immunopathogenesis of Johne 's disease <p> A research team has unraveled the immunopathogenesis of Johne 's disease , a chronic bovine disease that has caused endemics in Japan and many other countries , placing financial burdens on cattle farmers . <p> Researchers of Hokkaido University , the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization ( NARO ) , and Tohoku University demonstrated that a physiologically active substance called prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) impairs the immune response by upregulating the expression of an immunoinhibitory molecule , programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) , in cattle affected with Johne 's disease . The discovery is expected to help develop a method to control Johne 's disease , which is most frequently reported among legally designated infectious bovine diseases in Japan . <p> Johne 's disease is a type of chronic enteritis caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis , leading to diarrhea and weight loss in cattle , and occasionally death . This disease has led to endemics in Japan and 816 clinical cases were reported in 2017 . Cattle diagnosed with the disease must be culled to prevent its spread . Cattle farmers are also required to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a certain period , disinfect their cattle barns and are not allowed to move animals out of the farm freely . There has been no effective method to prevent the spread of the disease , including vaccination . <p> The researchers investigated the immunosuppressive effects of PGE2 , which is known to appear in increased amounts in cattle with Johne 's disease . Their experiments showed PGE2 has immunosuppressive effects on T-cell , a type of lymphocyte that plays an important role in the immune system . PGE2 also induced the upregulation of PD-L1 , a immunosuppressive molecule , in immune cells isolated from cows . The researchers also found PGE2 and PD-L1 were co-expressed in intestinal lesions of the infected cattle . <p> In addition , they found that the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) , which is involved in the synthesis of PGE2 , boosted immune response to the mycobacteria causing Johne 's disease . When COX-2 inhibitor is combined with anti-PD-L1 blocking antibodies , it further enhances the immune response to the mycobacteria . <p> \" Our data suggests that immunosuppressive effects of PGE2 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" says Associate Professor Satoru Konnai of the research team at Hokkaido University . \" We plan to conduct clinical trials to verify how the COX-2 inhibitor and anti-PD-L1 antibodies boost immune responses in cattle with Johne 's disease , in addition to examining the roles of PGE2 in cattle afflicted with other diseases . \" <p> Hand hygiene is critical to preventing the spread of infection in hospitals .
